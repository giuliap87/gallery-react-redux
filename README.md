### Gallery 

## Motivation

The aim of this project was to get familiar with redux and material ui (especially styles and custom components).

## Description

Picture gallery using React. The user can click on an image and move forwards or backwards in the gallery. The user can also apply filters to the images. 

## How to run it 

Clone repo. Set up: npm or yarn install. Start the app: npm or yarn start. 

## How to use it

The user can open an image by clicking on it and then move or back or forth in the gallery by using the arrow icons. 
The user can also apply filters using the navigation bar. Filters are 
saved in local storage. 

By clicking on the "Reset" button the user can remove all the filters and the images will return back to their original style.
