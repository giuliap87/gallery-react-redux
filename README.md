## Description:

Image gallery using react and redux. 
The aim of this project was to get familiar with redux. 

The user can open an image by clicking on it and then move on or back in the gallery. 

The user can also apply filters using the navigation bar. Filters are 
saved in local storage. 

By clicking on the "Reset" button the user can remove all the filters and the image will be back to its original style.
